## SNAP_StaMPS

There are the steps of PS-InSAR using SNAP_StaMPS

### STEP1

The first step is to find a region of interest and download the Sentinel-1 images. We can use Google Earth Engine and PIE Engine to have a look at first.
Then we can use the ASF website <https://search.asf.alaska.edu/> to find and download the images.

### STEP2

We can use model folder in this STEP.

#### 2.1 Split

#### 2.2 Apply Orbit

#### 2.1 + 2.2

### 2.3 Registration

Yes, this step is just registration. However, it's better to put the images in order and use the 1s DEM. 
This step will last for a relatively long time.
