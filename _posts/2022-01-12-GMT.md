## GMT diary

This is my first diary in github, I want to use English to write this because I want to practice my English.

So the topic of this is the GMT. I want to draw some pictures using GMT.

### STEP0

Since GMT is  Generic Mapping Tools, so I want to read a book named Introduction to Geographic Infomation System.
In order to get a Methodology of mapping.

There are ? substeps:
####  1.map image 2.grid & annotation 3.scale 4.text 5.legend 6.direction

### STEP1.map image

The first step is to download a tiff from the Google Earth Engine and I think this need another link

#### 1.1 use Sentinel-2 Explorer app to find the right image
#### 1.2 use a script to download the image

Then we will get a .tif image so we will turn to GMT

#### 1.3 use GMT

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set g=7
gmt begin taiwan_relief png,pdf
gmt basemap -JM15c -R118/125/20/26 -Baf -BWSen
gmt makecpt -Cglobe -T-8000/8000
gmt grdimage @earth_relief_01m -I+d
gmt colorbar -Bxa2000 -B+l"m"
gmt end show
```
